# CdmBatch

## Installation on Windows

Before we can start using cdm_batch on Windows machine, we need to make sure Ruby and Git are installed.

### Installing Ruby
Download Ruby 2.1.7 from [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org). Make sure to select the one-click installer, and not the archive. 

While following the installer instructions, when it asks about the installation path, use the default installation path, but make sure to tick the `Add Ruby executables to your PATH` and `Associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby Installation` checkboxes.

### Git

Download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer. 
* On the `Select Components` screen of the instllation, ensure that the `Windows Explorer Integration`, `Git Bash Here`, and `Git GUI Here` boxes are ticked.
* In the `Adjusting you PATH environment` screen, select the `Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt` option is ticked.

With those two steps complete, we can now install `cdm_batch`.

### Checkout the tul_cdm repository

In the start menu, search for "ruby" abnd the select `Start Command Prompt with Ruby`. This will start a command line window where we are going to run some commands to install .
